It was created to help eliminate repetitive manual and semi-automated testing. These manual tests could be complex and take a long time to set up and run, increasing the risk of introducing human-error into the process. It was also time-consuming to identify the cause of failures, as diagnostics were stored in different repositories, including logs and program compilation output on z/OS, and test script log output on laptops. Changes to IBM CICS could take many weeks to reach Beta as tests took too long to execute, increasing the time required to deliver. </p>"},{"location":"about/history/#the-solution","title":"The Solution","text":"<p>JAT was created to solve these problems. The framework was inspired by JUnit but with a focus on functional and integration testing.

However, the team found that Java expertise is not essential to use it. </p> <p>Executing a test was made much easier and quicker as test code could be run at the push of a single button. Automated scheduling of test runs enabled the continuous testing of new code in a timely and cost-effective manner.</p> <p>In JAT, all aspects of a test run are automatically recorded and stored in a single repository. If a test fails in an automated pipeline, simplified access to logs, screenshots and data makes it quick and easy to diagnose the problem.

Manual regression was virtually eliminated, giving the team more time to focus on exploratory testing to root out hard-to-find defects. Repeatable, scalable and reliable integration tests running as part of the DevOps pipeline helped to reduce the delivery of a new CICS feature from 18 to 3 months without any loss of confidence in quality.
