# galasa-docs-preview
A repository to hold the Galasa documentation + static site preview material.

This material is drawn from the `galasa` repository in this organisation.

The build process converts the source `.md` files into html, which is checked-in here when a pull request is committed to the `main` branch.

The `main` branch of this repository is used to host the documentation preview site, which can be reached at:
- https://galasa-dev.github.io/galasa-docs-preview/
- or (with a DNS re-direct to the above location) http://vnext.galasa.dev
